---

## Enhancement #1: Defensive Pact War Risk Assessment

**File:** `CvDiplomacyAI.cpp`  
**Location:** `DoMakeWarOnPlayer()` function (~line 27856)  
**Lines Added:** 39  
**Lines Removed:** 1 (comment replacement)  
**Net:** +38 lines

### What It Does

Before declaring war on a target, the AI now checks if that target has defensive pact allies who would become enemies. If multiple hostile allies would join the defense, the AI reassesses whether the war is still favorable.

### Code Changes

**Before (Current Branch):**
```cpp
// FIXME: Okay, so we're ready to declare war...but, can we exploit 
// Defensive Pacts to do so with fewer diplomatic penalties?
DeclareWar(eTargetPlayer);
```

**After (Backup Branch):**
```cpp
// Check if declaring war on this target would trigger defensive pacts 
// that create unfavorable matchups
int iAlliedAgainstUs = 0;
int iTargetAllyStrength = 0;

// Count defensive pact allies of the target that are hostile to us
for (int i = 0; i < MAX_MAJOR_CIVS; i++)
{
    PlayerTypes eLoopPlayer = (PlayerTypes)i;
    if (i == GetPlayer()->GetID() || !GET_PLAYER(eLoopPlayer).isAlive())
        continue;

    // Check if they have a defensive pact with the target
    if (GET_TEAM(GET_PLAYER(eLoopPlayer).getTeam()).IsHasDefensivePact(
        GET_PLAYER(eTargetPlayer).getTeam()))
    {
        iAlliedAgainstUs++;
        iTargetAllyStrength += GetMilitaryStrengthComparedToUs(eLoopPlayer);
    }
}

// If multiple hostile allies could join via defensive pacts, reassess war
if (iAlliedAgainstUs > 0)
{
    int iOurStrengthVsTarget = GetMilitaryStrengthComparedToUs(eTargetPlayer);
    if (iOurStrengthVsTarget > 0)
    {
        int iThreshold = (iOurStrengthVsTarget * 3) / 4;
        if (iTargetAllyStrength > iThreshold)
        {
            // Log decision and abort war
            CvString strLogName = "DiplomacyWarDecisions.log";
            FILogFile* pLog = LOGFILEMGR.GetLog(strLogName, FILogFile::kDontTimeStamp);
            CvString strLogMsg;
            strLogMsg.Format("CvDiplomacyAI::DoUpdateWarTargets - War against %s aborted: "
                "defensive pacts create unfavorable odds", 
                GET_PLAYER(eTargetPlayer).getName());
            if (pLog)
                pLog->Msg(strLogMsg);
            return;
        }
    }
}

DeclareWar(eTargetPlayer);
```

### Algorithm Explanation

1. **Count Allies:** Iterate through all major civs to find those with defensive pacts with the target
2. **Sum Strength:** Accumulate military strength of all hostile defensive pact allies
3. **Calculate Threshold:** Set threshold at 75% of our strength vs target (3/4 multiplier)
4. **Compare:** If allied strength exceeds threshold, abort war and log decision
5. **Decision:** Only declare war if odds are favorable

### Strategic Value

**Why This Matters:**
- ⭐ **Prevents unfavorable wars:** AI was sometimes declaring war without checking defensive pact consequences
- ⭐ **Smarter target selection:** Forces evaluation of coalition threats
- ⭐ **Realistic diplomacy:** Reflects how human players assess defensive pact risk
- ⭐ **Reduces DOW spam:** AI will think twice before declaring war on protected targets

**Example Scenario:**
```
Current AI behavior:
  - AI wants to attack Target (medium strength)
  - Declares war without checking
  - Result: 3 defensive pact allies join → AI loses war

With enhancement:
  - AI checks defensive pact allies first
  - Sees 3 allies with 80% of own strength
  - Threshold is 75% → exceeds threshold
  - Aborts war decision, logs reason
  - Result: Avoids unwinnable war
```

### Implementation Risk

| Aspect | Risk Level | Reason |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| API compatibility | ✅ NONE | Uses existing GetMilitaryStrengthComparedToUs() method |
| Logic correctness | ✅ LOW | Straightforward comparison logic |
| Performance | ✅ LOW | Single loop through MAX_MAJOR_CIVS (~10 iterations) |
| Gameplay impact | ✅ LOW | Makes AI smarter, not broken |

### Recommendation

**✅ IMPLEMENT** - This is valuable and low-risk strategic logic

## Enhancement #2: Score Victory Validation

**File:** `CvDiplomacyAI.cpp`  
**Location:** `GetScoreVictoryProgress()` function (~line 3049)  
**Lines Added:** 8  
**Lines Removed:** 1 (comment update)  
**Net:** +7 lines

### What It Does

Adds validation to ensure Score victory is actually enabled in the game before calculating progress toward it.

### Code Changes

**Before (Current Branch):**
```cpp
/// How close are we to achieving a Time victory?
/// FIXME: Needs a "is time victory disabled?" check before this function 
///        can be of much use
int CvDiplomacyAI::GetScoreVictoryProgress() const
{
    if (!m_pPlayer->isAlive() || GC.getGame().getWinner() != NO_TEAM)
        return 0;

    int iProgress = 0;
    int iOurScore = 0;
    int iHighestScore = 0;
    // ... rest of function
```

**After (Backup Branch):**
```cpp
/// How close are we to achieving a Score victory?
int CvDiplomacyAI::GetScoreVictoryProgress() const
{
    if (!m_pPlayer->isAlive() || GC.getGame().getWinner() != NO_TEAM)
        return 0;

    VictoryTypes eVictoryType = (VictoryTypes)GC.getInfoTypeForString("VICTORY_SCORE");
    if (eVictoryType == NO_VICTORY || !GC.getGame().isVictoryValid(eVictoryType))
        return 0;

    int iProgress = 0;
    int iOurScore = 0;
    int iHighestScore = 0;
    // ... rest of function
```

### What Changed

1. **Corrected comment:** "Time victory" → "Score victory"
2. **Added victory type lookup:** Gets the enum value for VICTORY_SCORE
3. **Added validation check:** Returns 0 if victory is disabled or invalid

### Strategic Value

**Why This Matters:**
- ✅ **Fixes FIXME comment:** Resolves the noted gap in the original code
- ✅ **Prevents invalid calculations:** Won't calculate progress on disabled victories
- ✅ **Better mod compatibility:** Handles game configurations where Score victory is disabled
- ⭐ **Prevents data errors:** Ensures calculations only happen when victory is valid

**Impact:**
- If Score victory is disabled → function returns 0 (correct)
- If Score victory is enabled → function calculates normally (unchanged behavior)

### Implementation Risk

| Aspect | Risk Level | Reason |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| API compatibility | ✅ NONE | Uses standard GC.getGame().isVictoryValid() |
| Logic correctness | ✅ NONE | Simple guard clause |
| Performance | ✅ NONE | Two simple checks, no loops |
| Gameplay impact | ✅ NONE | Only affects disabled victory configs |

### Recommendation

**✅ IMPLEMENT** - Fixes existing FIXME and improves robustness

## Enhancement #3: Deal Renewal Preparation

**File:** `CvDiplomacyAI.cpp`  
**Location:** `DoSendStatementToPlayer()` function (~line 30837)  
**Lines Added:** 6  
**Lines Removed:** 0  
**Net:** +6 lines

### What It Does

Adds deal renewal preparation before sending deal requests to ensure the deal is properly formatted for renewal.

### Code Changes

**Before (Current Branch):**
```cpp
if(eMessageType != NUM_DIPLO_MESSAGE_TYPES)
{
    CvDeal kDeal = *pDeal;
    szText = GetDiploStringForMessage(eMessageType);
    CvDiplomacyRequests::SendDealRequest(GetID(), ePlayer, &kDeal, 
        DIPLO_UI_STATE_TRADE_AI_MAKES_OFFER, szText, LEADERHEAD_ANIM_REQUEST, 
        /* bRenew */ true);
}
```

**After (Backup Branch):**
```cpp
if(eMessageType != NUM_DIPLO_MESSAGE_TYPES)
{
    CvDeal kDeal = *pDeal;
    CvGameDeals::PrepareRenewDeal(&kDeal);          // NEW
    pDeal->m_bCheckedForRenewal = true;             // NEW
    szText = GetDiploStringForMessage(eMessageType);
    CvDiplomacyRequests::SendDealRequest(GetID(), ePlayer, &kDeal, 
        DIPLO_UI_STATE_TRADE_AI_MAKES_OFFER, szText, LEADERHEAD_ANIM_REQUEST, 
        /* bRenew */ true);
}
```

### What Changed

1. **Call PrepareRenewDeal():** Ensures deal has proper renewal formatting
2. **Set renewal flag:** Marks deal as checked for renewal

### Additional Location

Same enhancement appears in another deal sending path (AI to AI deals):
```cpp
else
{
    CvDeal kDeal = *pDeal;
    CvGameDeals::PrepareRenewDeal(&kDeal);  // NEW
    // ... rest of AI-to-AI deal sending
}
```

### Strategic Value

**Why This Matters:**
- ✅ **Ensures deal validity:** PrepareRenewDeal() validates deal data
- ✅ **Prevents renewal bugs:** Properly formats deal before renewal proposal
- ✅ **Consistent with deal renewal:** Follows same pattern as deal renewal system
- ⭐ **Improves deal stability:** Reduces chance of malformed deals during renewal

**Impact:**
- Better deal renewal proposals
- Fewer invalid deal states
- More reliable AI-to-AI deal exchanges

### Implementation Risk

| Aspect | Risk Level | Reason |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| API compatibility | ✅ NONE | PrepareRenewDeal() is standard game function |
| Logic correctness | ✅ NONE | Defensive preparation, no logic changes |
| Performance | ✅ NONE | Single function call |
| Gameplay impact | ✅ NONE | Only improves deal reliability |

### Recommendation

**✅ IMPLEMENT** - Low-cost improvement to deal system reliability

---

## Code Removal Analysis

The backup also **removed** some problematic code that was generating renewal deals in an inefficient way:

**Removed from CancelRenewDeal() (~line 50002):**
```cpp
// find the deal in m_CurrentDeal and mark it as canceled
CvGameDeals& kGameDeals = GC.getGame().GetGameDeals();
DealList::iterator it;
for (it = kGameDeals.m_CurrentDeals.begin(); it != kGameDeals.m_CurrentDeals.end(); ++it)
{
    if (*it == *pRenewalDeal)
    {
        it->m_bConsideringForRenewal = false;
    }
}
GC.getGame().GetGameDeals().DoUpdateCurrentDealsList();
```

**Why This Was Removed:**
- ❌ Duplicated work (manual iteration through deals)
- ❌ Inefficient (full list scan for single deal)
- ✅ Replaced by direct flag setting: `pRenewalDeal->m_bConsideringForRenewal = false;`

**Impact:** Cleaner code, same functionality, better performance
